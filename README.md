## üöÄ Introduction

VibeCode is an innovative interactive coding platform designed to elevate software development skills by integrating cutting-edge AI assistance directly into the problem-solving workflow. Unlike traditional platforms that focus solely on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), VibeCode empowers developers to tackle real-world software engineering challenges ‚Äì from debugging complex code to generating comprehensive documentation ‚Äì with intelligent AI guidance.

## üí° The Problem VibeCode Solves

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, developers are increasingly expected to leverage AI tools. However, simply asking an AI to "do the work" often leads to a superficial understanding and a lack of critical problem-solving skills. VibeCode addresses this by:

*   **Bridging the Gap:** Moving beyond theoretical DSA problems to practical, multi-faceted software engineering scenarios.
*   **Fostering True Understanding:** Positioning AI as a powerful assistant that provides hints, explains concepts, and suggests approaches, rather than a black box that delivers instant, unexamined solutions.
*   **Cultivating Prompt Engineering Skills:** Encouraging users to craft precise and effective prompts to get the most out of AI models, a crucial skill for the future of development.
*   **Simulating Real-World Workflows:** Providing an environment where developers learn to integrate AI tools iteratively into their development process.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Solution

VibeCode is built around a unique philosophy: **AI as a co-pilot, not an autopilot.**

*   **Interactive Coding Environment:** A robust, in-browser code editor (powered by CodeMirror) with syntax highlighting and language support (JavaScript, Python).
*   **Multi-faceted Challenges:** A curated set of problems that go beyond typical LeetCode-style questions, focusing on practical software engineering tasks.
*   **Contextual AI Chat:** An integrated AI assistant that understands the specific problem context (code, task type, constraints) and provides relevant, actionable advice.
*   **User-Driven Problem Solving:** The AI never directly edits the user's code. Users must understand the AI's suggestions, apply them, and verify their solutions.
*   **Secure API Key Management:** Users can securely integrate their own API keys for various AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic), ensuring privacy and control over their AI usage.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate evaluation of solutions, providing clear feedback on correctness and adherence to task requirements.

## üéØ Challenge Modules (MVP Focus)

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) demonstrates the core value proposition through specialized AI-driven challenge modules:

### üêõ The "Debugging Assistant" Challenge

Users are presented with code containing subtle bugs and a set of failing test cases. The goal is to use the AI conversationally to:

*   **Diagnose:** Ask the AI to analyze error messages, stack traces, or code snippets to identify potential root causes.
*   **Trace:** Request the AI to explain code execution flow or variable states.
*   **Suggest Fixes:** Prompt the AI for potential solutions or alternative approaches.

The user then applies these insights to fix the code manually in the editor. The problem is designed to be multifaceted, requiring the user to interpret AI output, experiment, and apply critical thinking, rather than simply copying a solution.

### üìù The "Documentation Writer" Challenge

Users are given an undocumented codebase (e.g., a JavaScript module) and are tasked with generating comprehensive documentation (e.g., JSDoc comments, README files). The AI assistant helps by:

*   **Drafting:** Generating initial JSDoc comments for functions or sections of code.
*   **Structuring:** Suggesting sections and content for README files.
*   **Refining:** Helping to improve clarity, conciseness, and accuracy of the generated text.

The user's challenge lies in guiding the AI effectively, reviewing its output for accuracy and completeness, and integrating the documentation into the project. The evaluation checks for adherence to documentation standards and completeness, not just the presence of text.
